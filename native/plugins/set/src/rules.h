// Interception rules (SET docs/architecture.md): conditions and value changes a mod declares once, applied by C++ on
// whichever thread calls the hooked function. At call time a rule takes no lock, allocates nothing and calls no Lua.
// A rule's shape is fixed when it registers; only its params, its id list and its active flag change afterwards, each
